Manage your account from the **Manage Account** link in the user menu (click your avatar in the top-right corner).

## Signing up

Create an account at `/signup`:

1. Enter your email address.
2. Create a password (minimum 8 characters).
3. Confirm the password.
4. Click **Create account**. You're signed in and taken to the Forms page.

Your email is also the contact address used for email notifications, so use an address you actually read.

## Your first sign-in to Canopy Sites

Canopy sets up your Canopy Sites account when your site goes live, and sends you a link (by text or email) to set your password. Open it, choose a password, and you're signed in. The link works once and lasts a week. If it has expired, the page offers to email you a new one.

## Signing in

Sign in at `/login` with your email and password. Login errors are intentionally generic ("Invalid email or password") to avoid revealing whether an account exists for a given address.

Canopy Forms accounts sign in at forms.canopyds.com and Canopy Sites accounts at sites.canopyds.com. If you sign in at the other one, Forms customers see where to sign in, and Sites customers get a **Go to Canopy Sites** button that signs them in there.

## Email

Your email address is shown on the Account page. It's used for:

- Signing in
- Password reset links
- Receiving email notifications (your address is added as the first recipient automatically when you enable notifications on a form)

Email addresses cannot currently be changed from the Account page.

## Time zone

Your account has one time zone. Email notifications give each submission's time in it, and on a Canopy Sites website a dated announcement starts and ends on its days.

To change it, open **Time zone** on the Account page and pick your city, or any city that shares your time. Search by city ("Denver") or by the zone's name ("Mountain Time"). It saves as soon as you pick.

A new account starts in the time zone of the browser it was created in. Canopy sets it for Canopy Sites accounts.

## Changing your password

On the Account page, fill in:

1. **Current Password**
2. **New Password** (minimum 8 characters)
3. **Confirm New Password**

Click **Change Password**. You stay signed in here, and every other device or browser signed in to your account is signed out.

If the current password is wrong, the form shows an error and nothing changes.

## Forgot password

If you can't sign in:

1. Click **Forgot password?** on the login page, or go to `/forgot-password`.
2. Enter your email.
3. You'll see a confirmation message whether or not the address is registered (this prevents someone from probing for accounts).
4. If an account exists, you'll receive an email with a reset link. If you haven't set a password yet, the email is your link to set one instead.
5. The link lands on `/reset-password` and is valid for **one hour**. Each link can only be used once, and requesting a new one cancels any earlier link.
6. Enter a new password and confirm it. On success you're signed out on every device and redirected to the login page.

If the link expired or has already been used, request a new one from the Forgot Password page.

## Deleting your account

Deleting an account removes everything permanently. Before you delete, export any submissions you want to keep (each form has its own CSV/JSON export on the Submissions tab).

1. Go to the Account page.
2. Scroll to **Delete Account**.
3. Click **Delete Account** and confirm in the dialog.

What gets deleted:

- Your user record and password
- Your account
- Every form you own
- Every field and submission on those forms
- Any pending password-reset tokens for your email

There is no recovery. If you want to come back later, sign up again with the same email.

If your account includes a website we host, the Delete Account card has no button. Contact support to close the account.

## Security features

A few things worth knowing about how accounts are protected:

- Passwords are hashed with scrypt before they're stored. Plaintext passwords are never persisted.
- After five failed sign-ins for an email address, sign-in for that address pauses for 15 minutes. Password reset requests are limited the same way.
- Password reset links are single-use and expire after one hour.
- Generic error messages on login and password reset prevent email enumeration.
