# Future Features

## Separate Label/Value for Select Options

**Current behavior (v3.2):** Users enter the option name once, and it's used as both the label (what users see) and value (what gets stored).

**Future enhancement:** Add ability to specify different submission values from labels. For example:
- Label: "United States" → Value: `US` (for CRM/API integration)
- Label: "Pro Plan - $29/month" → Value: `plan_pro` (for billing system compatibility)

**Use case:** Enables advanced integrations with CRMs, payment gateways, and other systems that require specific data formats or codes.

## Conditional Fields (Show/Hide Based on Parent Option)

**Future enhancement:** Ability to show or hide fields based on the value selected in a parent field (e.g. select, radio).

**Feature details:**
- In the form editor, configure a field to be "conditional": it is only visible (or only required) when a chosen parent field has a specific option selected.
- Parent field is typically a select or radio group; option can be single value or "any of" a set.
- Supports chaining: conditional fields can themselves be parents for further conditional fields.
- Use cases: "If you selected 'Other', show a text field for details"; "If plan is 'Enterprise', show company size and contact fields"; multi-step-like flows within a single form.

**Technical considerations:**
- Form schema needs a way to store conditional rules (parent field id, trigger value(s), show vs. require).
- Embed (and preview) must evaluate conditions in real time as the respondent changes the parent field.
- Submission payload can either omit hidden fields or include them with a sentinel (e.g. not applicable); analytics and exports should handle both.

## Pre-built Templates

**Future enhancement:** Offer a library of pre-built form templates that users can start from instead of a blank form.

**Feature details:**
- Templates cover common use cases (contact, feedback, registration, event sign-up, job application, NPS survey, etc.).
- Each template includes field structure, labels, and optional default theme/appearance.
- User chooses a template when creating a new form (or from a "Start from template" action); the new form is created as a copy so the template itself stays unchanged.
- Optionally: allow saving the current form as a custom template (per workspace or org).

**Use case:** Speeds up form creation, reduces blank-canvas friction, and demonstrates best practices (e.g. good field types and layout for a given purpose).

**Technical considerations:**
- Template definitions (schema + optional theme) need a storage/versioning approach (e.g. seed data, bundled JSON, or DB rows).
- "Create from template" is a variant of "create new form" that pre-populates fields and optionally theme from the chosen template.

## Hosting

**Future enhancement:** Stand-alone front end. Canopy Forms-branded for use by individuals

## Email Field Auto-Send Configuration

**Future enhancement:** Allow email field types to automatically send emails to the submitted email address.

**Feature details:**
- Configure auto-send behavior per email field in the form editor
- Define email template (subject, body) in the dashboard
- Support for merge tags to include submitted form data in the email
- Use cases: confirmation emails, thank you messages, download links, next steps

**Technical considerations:**
- Requires email template editor in admin UI
- Template variables/merge tags for dynamic content
- Integration with existing SMTP configuration
- May want to combine with broader "Email to Submitter" feature

## Email to Submitter

**Future enhancement:** The ability to configure a form to send an email to the person who submitted it. Would require an email editor which is a lot of extra work. May need to wait until a major level bump which would also include some customization of the hosted solution.

## Email Change

**Future enhancement:** Allow authenticated users to update their email address from within the app.

**Feature details:**
- User initiates email change from account settings
- Verification email sent to the new address
- Old address receives a notification of the change
- Change is only confirmed after the new address is verified
- Re-authentication (password prompt) required before initiating the change

**Technical considerations:**
- Requires email verification flow (token-based)
- Should invalidate any existing sessions or prompt re-login after confirmed change
- Guard against email enumeration during the verification step

## Click Anywhere to Activate

**Future enhancement:** Rows and cards that open, expand, or edit something should respond to a click anywhere on them, not only on a small icon. The Fields list does this (clicking a collapsed field row opens it); the rest of the app still mostly relies on pencil and chevron icons. Audit list rows, settings rows, and collapsible cards and apply the same rule, keeping drag handles and destructive actions as their own targets.

## Preview Halo (Inspect-Style Highlight)

**Future enhancement:** When the user focuses or hovers an appearance control (e.g. "Field Background", "Border Radius"), highlight the corresponding element(s) in the live preview—similar to browser DevTools "inspect element" highlighting.

**Use case:** Makes it obvious which part of the form each setting affects, especially for colors and typography.

**Partly built:** the editor marks the focused header input and the open field row with a hand-drawn box (`PreviewMark`, see `docs/UX_PATTERNS.md` section 10), and styling mode marks everything a styling group changes when the group is hovered in the preview or opened. Individual controls don't mark their own elements yet.

**Technical considerations:**
- Preview and editor are same document; no iframe, so we can query the preview container DOM from the admin app.
- Option A (admin-only): Maintain a theme-key → CSS selector map in the admin (e.g. `fieldBackground` → `.canopy-input, .canopy-textarea, .canopy-select`). On focus/hover, set context (e.g. `previewHighlight`), then in the preview panel use an effect to `querySelectorAll` inside the container and add a halo class; inject admin-side styles for the halo (outline/box-shadow). Keep selector map in sync with embed classes.
- Option B (embed-assisted): Embed adds `data-canopy-theme="fieldBackground"` (or similar) to elements when rendering; admin or embed exposes e.g. `highlightThemeKey(key)` to toggle a halo class. Single source of truth; survives embed DOM changes.
- Clear halo on blur/mouseLeave. Consider debounce so rapid hover across controls doesn’t flicker.

**Future enhancement:** Multiple titled sections on the form
